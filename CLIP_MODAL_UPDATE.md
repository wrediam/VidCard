# Clip Suggestions Modal Update

## Overview
Separated clip suggestions into its own dedicated modal to prevent UI cramping and provide a better user experience.

## Changes Made

### **1. New Dedicated Modal**
Created `clipSuggestionsModal` - a separate full-screen modal for clip suggestions, similar to the post suggestions modal structure.

**Features:**
- ✅ Orange/Red gradient header (distinct from purple/blue posts modal)
- ✅ Back button to return to AI Tools selection
- ✅ Close button to exit completely
- ✅ Full-width layout (max-w-5xl) for better video embed viewing
- ✅ Initial view with "Generate Clip Suggestions" button
- ✅ Results view with navigation and YouTube embeds

### **2. Updated AI Tools Modal**
The AI Tools modal now serves as a selection screen with two options:
- **Social Media Posts** - Opens post suggestions in the same modal
- **Clip Suggestions** - Opens the new dedicated clip modal

### **3. Navigation Flow**

```
Transcript Modal
    ↓ (Click "AI Tools")
AI Tools Modal (Selection Screen)
    ├─→ Generate Posts (stays in AI Tools Modal)
    └─→ Generate Clips (opens Clip Suggestions Modal)
            ↓ (Back button)
        AI Tools Modal (Selection Screen)
```

### **4. JavaScript Functions Added**

```javascript
// Open the clip suggestions modal
openClipSuggestionsModal()

// Close the clip suggestions modal
closeClipSuggestionsModal()

// Return to AI Tools selection screen
backToAITools()
```

### **5. Keyboard Navigation**
Updated keyboard navigation to work independently in each modal:
- **AI Tools Modal**: Arrow keys navigate post suggestions
- **Clip Modal**: Arrow keys navigate clip suggestions
- No interference between modals

### **6. UI Improvements**

**Before:**
- Both tools cramped in one modal
- Confusing navigation between tools
- Limited space for video embeds

**After:**
- Each tool has dedicated space
- Clear navigation with back button
- Full-width video embeds (max-w-5xl)
- Better visual hierarchy with color-coded headers

## Visual Design

### **AI Tools Modal (Selection)**

- Two-column grid layout
- Clear tool descriptions

### **Clip Suggestions Modal**
- Orange/Red gradient header (matches clip theme)
- Full-width layout for video viewing
- Prominent navigation controls
- Detailed clip information display

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Each tool has dedicated space without cramping
